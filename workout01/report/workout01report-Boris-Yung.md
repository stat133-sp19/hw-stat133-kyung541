One of the biggest stars in the NBA, **Kevin Durant**, had decided to join the Golden State Warriors in the 2017-2018 season to go after the champion title that many Hall of Fame basketball player have. He will definitely become one of the Hall of Famer in the NBA because he is such a great and effective offensive player which allow him to win a seasonal MVP title before. And yet, because he is such a great attacker, he needs the ball most of the time which able him move with the ball and attack the basket (He is less likely to move without the ball). And don't forget, during that time, Warriors had already had three other All-stars player in the team as well; it included **Stephen Curry**, **Klay Thompson** and **Graymand Green** (which I don't really agree with). **Stephen Curry** is the team's point guard and one of the best 3-pt shooters in the league. He is famous for his unlimited shot range and the quick release of his shots. **Klay Thompson** is the team's shooting guards and an elite overall player. He can player both defend and offend position and also an accurate 3-points shooters as well. Both of them did also need to move with the ball in order to attack the basket (Although Curry always catch and shots as well as making pull up jumping right after some dribble move that he used to create some space between him and the defender). Hence, will **Kevin Durant** able to maintain his efficiency when he is with the **Golden State Warriors Team** since the team have already packed with talented NBA players?

To answer my question, the easiest way is to compare their shooting efficiency of 2018 NBA season among the Golden State Warriors' players. But first, I would love to show you guys the shooting chart of five players; ***Stephen Curry***, ***Klay Thompson***, ***Kevin Durant***, \*\*\* Andre Iguodala\*\*\* and ***Graymand Green*** in 2018 NBA season. Hence it can allow us to understand how's the team work on offense and who is the one who most likely to execute different possession.

From these charts, we can see that both Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson had taken a lot of shots. Because they are the shooters in the team (The Splash Brother), so it is typical that they take more shots than others because one of the main roles is scoring. Moreover, Kevin Durant did also take a lot of shots in 2017-2018 season as well. It is also natural because Kevin is famous for his ability to attack the basket, hence it's explained why he would have taken shots more than other players. For the player Andre Iguodala, his main role in the team are more likely to be the lock down defender; also, he is a below average shooters for outside range, but he has an amazing athleticism, therefore he is typical took fewer shots than Durant, Thompson and Curry. Draymand is an average shooter overall as well, but really not that good and 3pts range. Because he is physical and strong, most of his shots were made near the basket.

Next, we are going to see and study the efficiency tables of these 5 players in **2pts**, **3pts** and **overall pts**.

According to this 2pts effective shooting (in percentage) table, we can see that Andre Iguodala have the highest percentage (64%) of made shot amount all of the five players. It is because we all know that Andre Iguodala is a below average shooter from outside range, therefore, his shooting selection are more likely to be closer to the basket. On the other hand, Kevin Durant has about 61% of made shot in typically 2-pt range according to the table. Hence, we know that Kevin Durant did maintain his efficiency in 2-pts range as a excellent offensive player as before.
