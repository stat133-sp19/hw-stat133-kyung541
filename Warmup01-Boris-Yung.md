$$\\\\$$
 \* 1 to 4 pounds chicken wings that have been cut into flats and drumettes. \* 1 1/2 teaspoons to 2 tablespoons baking powder (using 1 1/2 teaspoons per pound). \* 1 to 4 teaspoons kosher salt (using 1 teaspoon per pound; use less salt if you’re not using Diamond brand). \* 2 tablespoons hot sauce (Frank’s RedHot is traditional) per pound of wings. \* 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter per pound of wings. \* To serve (optional): Homemade Blue Cheese Dressing, plus celery and carrot sticks.

##### Special kitchen tools

-   Large baking shhet with foil
-   oven-safe cooling rack

##### Steps

1.  Pat wings dry with a paper towel
2.  Toss them with 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon kosher salt per pound of wings in a large bowl until thoroughly coated.
3.  Arrange them on the rack with some space between them (the surface will not dry and crisp as well where they touch) and place in your refrigerator uncovered for 8 to 24 hours.
4.  Heat your oven to 450 degrees, with a rack set in the top half of your oven.
5.  Bake your wings for 20 minutes
6.  Flip them with tongs or a spatula, bake them for another 15 minutes
7.  Flip them back over again, and then for 15 final minutes, for a total roasting time of 50 minutes.

(Addidtion) You might need up to 5 minutes longer for larger wings. Wings are done with they are browned and crisp.

######## In a medium saucepan, for each **pound** of wings

Combine 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and 1 1/2 tablespoons (for a hotter sauce) to 2 tablespoons (for a mild, more buttery sauce) unsalted butter over medium heat until melted, whisking to combine. Set aside.

*There is no special season of the year to enjoy buffalo wings. You can enjoy buffalo wings ay any time you wants.*

*There are no any other recipe for bake buffalo wings. If you want to have try out different wings, there are pleanty of recipe that can teach you how to make other kind of wings!!!*

**Euclidean Distance**
======================

**Definition** [edit]()
-----------------------

The **Eucliden distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the [line segment]() connecting them. ().

In Cartesian coordinates(), if $\\boldsymbol{p} = (P\_{1}, P\_{2},\\dotsc,P\_{n})$ and **q** = are two points in [Euclidean *n-*space](), then the distance 9d0 from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula.

d(**p**,**q**) = d(**q**,**p**) = $\\sqrt{(q\_{1}- p\_{1})^2 +  (q\_{2}- p\_{2})^2 + \\dots + q\_{n}-p\_{n}^2}$ = $\\sqrt{\\displaystyle\\sum\_{i=1}^{10} (q\_{i}-p\_{i})^2}$

The posotion of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Euclidean vector](). So,**p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with ther tips ( terminal points) ending at the two points. The [Euclidean norm](), or **Euclidean length** or **magnitude** of a vecttor measurethe length of he vector:

∥*p*∥ = $\\sqrt{P\_1^2 + P\_2^2 + \\dots + P\_n^2}$ = $\\sqrt{\*\*P\*\*. \*\*p\*\*}$,

wherre the last expression involves the [dot product]().
